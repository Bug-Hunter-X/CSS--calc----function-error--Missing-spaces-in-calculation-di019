The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly causing unexpected results. The issue lies in the calculation within `calc()`, potentially due to missing spaces between operators and operands or incorrect unit usage.  For example: `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is correct, but `width:calc(100%-10px);` is incorrect.
