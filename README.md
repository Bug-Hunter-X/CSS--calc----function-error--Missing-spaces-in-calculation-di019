# CSS `calc()` Function Error: Missing Spaces

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The issue arises from the lack of spaces between operators and operands within the `calc()` expression.

**Bug:** Missing spaces in the `calc()` function can cause unexpected results or the CSS to fail to parse.

**Solution:** Ensure that there are spaces between operators (+, -, *, /) and operands (numbers, percentages, units).
